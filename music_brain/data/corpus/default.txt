The silence is a heavy door.
I found only static.
Broken glass reflects the sky.
The machine breathes.
I am static.
Walls close in like whispers.
The echo remembers what I forgot.
Time moves like honey through broken glass.
Nothing stays the same except the ache.
The light fades but the shadow remains.
I carry stones in my chest.
Words dissolve before they reach my mouth.
The distance between us is measured in silence.
I built walls to keep the storm out.
Now I am the storm.
Every ending is a door I forgot to close.
The weight of maybe presses down.
I am the pause between heartbeats.
Something broke and I pretend not to hear it.
The mirror shows someone I used to know.
